# Compare functional programming in Go with JavaScript

This paper compares functional programming in Go with functional programming in JavaScript.
It compares the type system, functions and functional programming in Go with JavaScript.
As a practical example for the comparison of the two programming languages a bool parser is implemented in both languages.

<!-- Functions -->
<!-- Lambdas/closures -->
<!-- Higher order functions -->
<!-- Sum/product types -->
<!-- Immutable types -->
<!-- Pattern matching -->
<!-- Monads -->
<!-- Function literals -->
<!-- Currying -->
