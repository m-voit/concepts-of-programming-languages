# Compare functional programming in Go with JavaScript

This paper compares functional programming in Go with functional programming in JavaScript.
It compares the type system, functions and functional programming in Go with JavaScript.
Furthermore, an implementation of a parser for boolean expressions is used as a practical example to compare functional programming in the two programming languages.
<!-- Paper will answer the question what functional concepts are present in javascript and which possibilities there are. -->

## JavaScript Overview

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language and a core technology of the internet.
It is a general purpose programming language and runs in the browser as well as on the server.
Despite often deceived as an object-oriented programming language, JavaScript also follows functional and imperative paradigms.
JavaScript is also event-driven and has good support for asynchronous programming.

<!-- Lambdas/closures -->
<!-- Higher order functions -->
<!-- Sum/product types -->
<!-- Immutable types -->
<!-- Pattern matching -->
<!-- Monads -->
<!-- Function literals -->
<!-- Currying -->

### Type system

JavaScript is a dynamic and weakly typed programming language, that also features duck-typing.
Because the language is weakly typed, types are implicitly casted depending on the used operation.
Furthermore, the dynamic typing allows for types to change their type at runtime, when their assigned value changes.

```javascript
text = "Hello World!"; // Type of text is string.
text = 5; // Type of text is now number.
```

<!-- TODO Describe why this helps with functional programming. -->
