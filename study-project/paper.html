<p>This paper compares functional programming in JavaScript with functional programming in Go.
At the beginning, it gives a short overview over JavaScript and it's history.
Furthermore, an implementation of a parser for Boolean expressions is used as a practical example to compare functional programming in the two programming languages.
Additionally, JavaScript and Go are compared on their support of basic and advanced functional programming concepts.
These functional programming concepts are explained and looked at in the paper.
At the end of the paper there will be an evaluation and summary on how suitable JavaScript is to implement a functional parser.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-overview">JavaScript Overview</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language and a core technology of the internet.
It is a general purpose programming language and runs in the browser as well as on the server.
Despite often deceived as an object-oriented programming language, JavaScript also follows functional and imperative paradigms.
JavaScript is also event-driven and has good support for asynchronous programming [moz01].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the original plan of Netscape was to integrate Scheme, a Lisp dialect, into their browser.
But for marketing reasons, it was decided, to create a new language with a syntax similar to Java.
Later the newly created language was called JavaScript and integrated into the Netscape browser.
While being a new language, JavaScript has taken the functional concepts of Scheme and integrated them in to the language, besides imperative and object-oriented concepts [ant16].</p>
<p>However, to stay within the scope of this paper, the focus will be on the functional aspects of JavaScript. These will be presented in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="parser-for-boolean-expressions">Parser for Boolean expressions</h2>
<p>The parser for Boolean expressions is a practical example to compare functional programming in Go and JavaScript.
It is implemented using functional programming concepts and will be used to provide code examples for various functional programming aspects discussed later.
Generally speaking the parser is built using parser combinators, which are a good example to be implemented with functional programming.
The parser parses Boolean expressions with the following EBNF grammar.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ebnf"><div>&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">e</span><span class="hljs-attribute">x</span><span class="hljs-attribute">p</span><span class="hljs-attribute">r</span><span class="hljs-attribute">e</span><span class="hljs-attribute">s</span><span class="hljs-attribute">s</span><span class="hljs-attribute">i</span><span class="hljs-attribute">o</span><span class="hljs-attribute">n</span>&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; { &lt;or&gt; &lt;term&gt; }
&lt;term&gt; ::= &lt;factor&gt; { &lt;and&gt; &lt;factor&gt; }
&lt;factor&gt; ::= &lt;var&gt; | &lt;not&gt; &lt;factor&gt; | (&lt;expression&gt;)
&lt;or&gt;  ::= <span class="hljs-string">'|'</span>
&lt;and&gt; ::= <span class="hljs-string">'&amp;'</span>
&lt;not&gt; ::= <span class="hljs-string">'!'</span>
&lt;var&gt; ::= <span class="hljs-string">'[a-zA-Z0-9]*'</span>
</div></code></pre>
<p><code>A &amp; B | !C</code> is a possible expression, that can be parsed by the parser.
Depending on the values of A, B and C, which can be true or false, the parser determines the result of the expression.
The expression is then parsed by building an abstract syntax tree (AST), consisting of <code>Or</code>, <code>And</code>, <code>Not</code> and <code>Value</code> nodes, mimicking the EBNF grammar.
The created AST allows it to determine the results of the expression, when A, B and C are replaced by either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<h2 id="functional-programming-concepts">Functional programming concepts</h2>
<p>Functional programming and the functional programming paradigm have various unique concepts.
To see how well JavaScript and Go are suited for functional programming, we will take a look on these concepts and their support in both languages.</p>
<h3 id="type-system">Type system</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a dynamic and weakly typed programming language, that also features duck-typing.
Weakly typed means, types are implicitly cast depending on the used operation.
Furthermore, dynamic typing allows for types to change their type at runtime, when their assigned value changes [moz05].</p>
<p>In the context of functional programming, the dynamic and weakly typing of JavaScript simplifies writing highly reusable functions.
This is especially useful for higher-order functions and function composition, because there is no need to use <code>any</code> types or do frequent type casts.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> makeOr = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">pair</span> =&gt;</span>
  pair.second <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> Nothing ? pair.first : <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Or(pair.first, pair.second);
</div></code></pre>
<p>Go on the other hand is a strict and strongly typed programming language.
This means types are explicitly assigned and cannot change after assignment, except when explicitly cast by the developer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are no generic types in Go, so we have to use an empty interface to simulate an <code>any</code> type.
This makes the code more verbose and less readable than JavaScript code, while providing no benefit to the developer.
Generally speaking, the Go type system is not tailored to functional programming and is more or less a hurdle to the developer, when used this way.</p>
<p>Additionally, using empty interfaces to simulate generic types has an impact on performance, especially when doing many type conversions.
This is no problem in the rather small parser example, but might become one at a larger scale and should therefore be mentioned [she17].</p>
<p>However, by using empty interfaces, it's possible to write flexible and reusable functions in Go.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><div><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">makeOr</span><span class="hljs-params">(argument <span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span>{})</span> <span class="hljs-title">interface</span></span>{} {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pair = argument.(Pair)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> pair.Second == (Nothing{}) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> pair.First
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> firstNode = pair.First.(ast.Node)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> secondNode = pair.Second.(ast.Node)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> ast.Or{LHS: firstNode, RHS: secondNode}
}
</div></code></pre>
<h3 id="immutability">Immutability</h3>
<p>Immutability is a desired property, especially in functional programming, because it reduces unintended side effects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, true immutability can't be achieved in JavaScript.
Although it's possible to create constructs that are sort of immutable, there is no built-in or default immutability as in pure functional programming languages.</p>
<p>One way to achieve immutability in JavaScript is to use the <code>const</code> keyword, that allows to define constant variables, functions or objects.
But while primitive types as strings are truly constant, when defined with the <code>const</code> keyword, objects created with the <code>const</code> keyword are still mutable [moz07].
As we can see in the example below, the properties of the <code>result</code> object can still be reassigned, despite the <code>result</code> object being declared as <code>const</code>.
So, used on an object, the <code>const</code> keyword only prevents to assign a new value to the object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> optional = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">parser</span> =&gt;</span> input =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> result = parser(input);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (result.result === <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
    result.result = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Nothing();
    result.remainingInput = input;
  }

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result;
};
</div></code></pre>
<p>Another way to achieve immutability is to <em>freeze</em> an object after creation.
This makes the object truly immutable, but still has the caveat, that it doesn't effect nested objects.
Therefore, it's necessary to call <em>freeze</em> recursively on an object that should be truly immutable [moz08].</p>
<p>However, this is prone to developer mistakes and may not play nicely with libraries expecting mutable objects.</p>
<p>In Go immutability is quite similar to JavaScript and can't be easily achieved.
Except strings, data types in Go are mutable by default and only primitive data types like <code>bool</code> and <code>int</code> can declared to be constant.
The immutability of composite data types like Go's <code>structs</code> on the other hand, is in the responsibility of the developer.</p>
<p>For Go 2.0 however, there is a proposal to introduce new immutable data types to Go.
So this might change in the future, when Go 2.0 is released [git01].</p>
<p>To sum it up, as of today there is some support for immutability in JavaScript and in Go, but not by default and not easily usable.</p>
<h3 id="first-class-functions">First class functions</h3>
<p>First class functions are the foundation of supporting functional programming in a programming language.
A language with first class functions has to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow passing functions as parameters to other functions.</li>
<li>Allow functions to be return values of other functions, so that functions can return functions.</li>
<li>Allow functions to be assigned to variables.</li>
<li>Allow functions to be stored in data structures like arrays.</li>
</ul>
<p>The listed properties also allow for concepts such as higher-order functions and functional composition, which both are described later.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, all the mentioned properties are supported.
Therefore, functions in JavaScript are first class functions and are treated like first-class citizens [moz06][fog13].
This allows us to assign the <code>optional()</code> and the <code>expectSeveral()</code> function to the <code>expectSpaces</code> variable in the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> expectSpaces = optional(expectSeveral(isSpaceChar, isSpaceChar));
</div></code></pre>
<p>The same holds true for Go, that has same support for first class functions than JavaScript [she17][gol01].
Like in JavaScript it's possible to assign the <code>ExpectSeveral()</code> and the <code>Optional()</code> function to the <code>ExpectSpaces</code> variable.
The only difference is the chaining of the function calls instead of nesting them and the explicit <code>Parser</code> type of the variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ExpectSpaces Parser = ExpectSeveral(isSpaceChar, isSpaceChar).Optional()
</div></code></pre>
<h3 id="closures-and-lambda-expressions">Closures and lambda expressions</h3>
<p>Closures or lambda expressions, also called anonymous functions, are unnamed functions, often returned from another function.
To be precise, a closure is the reference to the local state of the function, that returns an anonymous function.
However, both terms are often used interchangeably, because both concepts belong to the concept of anonymous functions, returned by an outer function [fog13].</p>
<p>Support for closures is found in all programming languages with first class functions.
This is the case, because closures are needed for anonymous functions to work.
Without closures and therefore no references to the <em>outer</em> function, that is returning the <em>inner</em> function, the <em>inner</em> function would stop working when being called directly [moz02][fog13].</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> convert = <span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">parser, converter</span>) =&gt;</span> input =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> result = parser(input);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (result.result !== <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
    result.result = converter(result.result);
  }

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result;
};
</div></code></pre>
<p>In JavaScript lambda expressions can be written very concisely with the arrow functions syntax, introduced with ECMAScript 6 [moz04].</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><div><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-params">(parser Parser)</span> <span class="hljs-title">Convert</span><span class="hljs-params">(converter <span class="hljs-keyword">func</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span>{})</span> <span class="hljs-title">interface</span></span>{}) Parser {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span><span class="hljs-params">(Input Input)</span> <span class="hljs-title">Result</span></span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> result = parser(Input)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> result.Result != <span class="hljs-literal">nil</span> {
      result.Result = converter(result.Result)
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result
  }
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>In Go lambda expressions are a bit more verbose, especially because the type system requires explicit types as mentioned in the type system section earlier.
Apart from that, lambda expressions in Go are equal to lambda expressions in JavaScript [she17].</p>
<h3 id="higher-order-functions-and-function-composition">Higher-order functions and function composition</h3>
<p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept other functions as arguments or return a function as their result.
As discussed in the first class functions section, JavaScript has first class functions and therefore allows writing and using higher-order functions.</p>
<p>The convert function of the Boolean parser for example takes two arguments.
A parser function to be executed and a converter function to convert the result of the parser function.
This higher order function can be used for any desired parser function and with an arbitrary converter function.
The result is a highly flexible and easily reusable function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> orElse = <span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">parser, alternativeParser</span>) =&gt;</span> input =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> firstResult = parser(input);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> firstResult.result !== <span class="hljs-literal">null</span> ? firstResult : alternativeParser(input);
};
</div></code></pre>
<p>In Go, the converter function looks similar to the JavaScript implementation.
This is the case, because Go has similar support for higher-order functions as JavaScript.
The main differences between the Go and the JavaScript implementation are the empty interfaces to satisfy the Go type system and the higher verbosity of the Go code.
Again the reason for this is the different type system of JavaScript and Go as discussed earlier [med02][she17].</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><div><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-params">(parser Parser)</span> <span class="hljs-title">OrElse</span><span class="hljs-params">(alternativeParser Parser)</span> <span class="hljs-title">Parser</span></span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span><span class="hljs-params">(Input Input)</span> <span class="hljs-title">Result</span></span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> FirstResult = parser(Input)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> FirstResult.Result != <span class="hljs-literal">nil</span> {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> FirstResult
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> alternativeParser(Input)
  }
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>Function composition is a concept that allows to build complex functions out of one or more simple functions.
Generally speaking, function composition is an application of higher-order functions.</p>
<!-- Currying -->
<p>Function composition works good in JavaScript, especially because of the permissive type system, discussed earlier.
It's easy and straight forward to use various functions to build complex functions.
This can be seen in the <code>converter</code> function example above.</p>
<p>In Go, function composition requires the programmer to use empty interfaces.
This is required by Go type system as discussed earlier.</p>
<h3 id="pure-functions">Pure functions</h3>
<p>Pure functions are functions that have no side effects and no hidden inner state.
This means, a function, given the same input, always produces the same output.
To achieve this a pure function only uses its input and doesn't use or mutate internal state.
This property of pure functions gives us referential transparency.
That means it's possible to replace a function with its result without changing the behaviour of a program.</p>
<p>JavaScript allows writing pure functions, but doesn't have special constructs to enforce side effect free and therefore pure functions [fog13].</p>
<p>The same holds true for Go.
Like in JavaScript, it's possible to write pure and side effect free functions in Go, but there are no special constructs to enforce these concepts.
Furthermore, because Go doesn't support tail-call optimization, which is discussed later, there is a performance impact on heavy use of pure functions and recursion.
So as long as there is no tail-call optimization in Go, pure functions should be used with precautions [she17].</p>
<p>Therefore, pure functions are possible in both languages, but it's in the responsibility of the programmer to keep them pure.</p>
<h3 id="lazy-evaluation">Lazy evaluation</h3>
<p>There are two ways to evaluate functions, eager and lazy evaluation.
Programming languages that use eager evaluation, evaluate a function as soon as it's assigned or defined.
Lazy evaluation, on the other hand, means that functions are evaluated when they are executed, which may happen much later than the assignment.</p>
<p>In the context of functional programming, lazy evaluation is useful for performance optimization.
This is possible, because functions are only evaluated, when they are actually used and therefore no unnecessary calculations are done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately both, Go and JavaScript, use eager evaluation for functions with no built-in support for lazy evaluation.
However, it's possible to simulate lazy evaluation in both languages, but it's no core part of the two programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="recursion-and-tail-call-optimization">Recursion and tail-call optimization</h3>
<p>To avoid mutating state functional programming makes heavy use of recursion.
Recursion happens when a function calls itself with new parameters to compute something instead of mutating state inside the function.
Unfortunately recursion is less efficient than iteration.</p>
<p>A technique to remedy the performance issues of recursion is called tail-call optimization.
Without tail-call optimization each recursive call to a function, adds a new stack frame to the call stack.
Therefore, the call stack grows with each function call and causes high memory usage on deeply nested recursion functions.
Tail-call optimization prevents this by overwriting the unneeded stack frames of the previous function calls.
So tail-call optimization is needed for efficient functional programming.</p>
<p>Tail-call optimization is a part of JavaScript since ECMAScript 6, which was introduced in 2015.</p>
<p>Go on the other side has no support for tail-call optimization and according to the Go developers, they don't see this as a problem affecting many people, so the won't add support for tail-call optimization [git04].
This means heavy using of recursion and functional programming in Go will have an impact on performance.
There are some workarounds for this issue, but they are out of the scope of this paper.[med02][she17]</p>
<p>Summarized, JavaScript has better support for efficient recursion heavy programming than Go.</p>
<h3 id="algebraic-data-types">Algebraic data types</h3>
<p>Algebraic data types, also named sum/product types or discriminate unions, are a concept in functional programming languages to represent data structures by composing them with other types.</p>
<p>An example for this is the AST of our parser example.
The AST is a data structure consisting of nodes with the <code>OR</code>, <code>AND</code>, <code>NOT</code> or <code>VALUE</code> type.</p>
<p>With support of algebraic data structure we could write the AST much more concisely as we can see in following example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> Or = { lhs: Node, rhs: Node };
<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> And = { lhs: Node, rhs: Node };
<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> Not = { ex: Node };
<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> Value = { name: <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> };

<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> Node = Or | And | Not | Value;
</div></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately this is not possible in JavaScript because it lacks types.
However, by using TypeScript, a JavaScript superset, it would be possible to use this syntax today.</p>
<p>In Go this feature isn't present either, but there is an ongoing discussion to introduce sum types along with generic types in Go 2.0 [gol02][git03].
This means, in the future, Go might get support for union types, allowing to easily represent AST nodes.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h3>
<p>Pattern matching is a concept found in functional programming languages like Haskell to work with data structures [has01].
It's often used in conjunction with algebraic data types to select different behaviour depending on the data type.</p>
<p>In our parser example this would be useful for the evaluate function that could be written in a more functional matter instead of using JavaScript classes.
There is a stage 1 proposal to introduce pattern matching to ECMAScript in the future [git02].
This means, in the future, the evaluate function could be written concisely as in the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> evaluate = <span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">vars, node</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> (node) {
  when (node <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> Or) -&gt; evaluate(vars, node.lhs) || evaluate(vars, node.rhs)
  when (node <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> And) -&gt; evaluate(vars, node.lhs) &amp;&amp; evaluate(vars, node.rhs)
  when (node <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> Not) -&gt; !evaluate(vars, node.ex)
  when (node <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> Value) -&gt; vars.get(node.name)
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>In Go on the other hand there is no support for pattern matching and there are no plans to introduce it to the language.
But it even in absent of pattern matching in Go, something similar can be achieved by using interfaces and switch statements [eli01].</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>After implementing the Boolean parser, it can be said that JavaScript is well suited to implement a parser.
As we have seen, JavaScript has good support for all the basic concepts of functional programming.
It's only missing some advanced concepts like pattern matching or algebraic data types, which would have simplified the parser implementation.</p>
<p>The only real downside is the dynamic and weakly typed type system of JavaScript.
While this allows for easily writing reusable functions, it also makes it hard to spot errors.
This was especially the case on some parser functions taking a lot of different inputs, like the convert function.
However, this disadvantage is more of general problem in JavaScript than a specific problem in functional programming.</p>
<p>When it comes to implementing the parser, the differences between Go and JavaScript are subtle.
The only outstanding difference is the higher verbosity of the Go code, due to type annotations and type casts.</p>
<p>In the big picture, when compared to Go, JavaScript shows more focus on functional programming, especially on topics like tail-call optimization or short lambda expressions.
To sum it up, the support of functional programming in JavaScript is more advanced than it is in Go.</p>
