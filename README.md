# Concepts of programming languages

![node-ci](https://github.com/m-voit/concepts-of-programming-languages/workflows/node-ci/badge.svg)

Study project to compare functional programming concepts in Go and JavaScript.
It was developed as part of a Computer Science (Masterâ€™s Degree) course at Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences.

The paper written as part of this study project is based on a parser for Boolean expressions.
It was developed in Go and JavaScript using parser combinators.
The Boolean expression parser was then used to evaluate the support of functional programming concepts in the two programming languages.

## Setup and requirements

A running Node.js 14.x installation is assumed. Other versions may work, but were not tested.

- To install dependencies required for running the tests run `npm install`.

## Usage

Open a terminal in the directory `./study-project/parser-js`.

- Run `npm run test` to execute the tests.
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to get a test coverage report.
